## 📋 HOW TO EXECUTE

### **Step 1: Set Up Agents**

For each agent 1-6:
1. Open the agent's folder in a NEW Cascade/Windsurf window
2. Give the agent their prompt file as first message
3. Agent starts working independently

**Example**:
```bash
# Terminal 1
cd "d:\Quantum MCP\Roo-Code-main\Roo-Code-main\packages\quantum-physics-core"
# Open in Cascade, paste AGENT_1_PHYSICS_CORE.md

# Terminal 2
cd "d:\Quantum MCP\Roo-Code-main\Roo-Code-main\packages\quantum-codegen"
# Open in Cascade, paste AGENT_2_CODE_GENERATION.md

# ... repeat for all 6 agents
```

### **Step 2: Daily Coordination**

**Every day**:
1. **Morning** (9 AM): Check all agents' progress
2. **Noon**: Coordinator resolves any blockers
3. **Evening** (6 PM): Review completed work
4. **Night**: Update `DAILY_PROGRESS.md`

**Coordination Channels**:
- Agent updates → Save to `AGENT_X_STATUS.md` in their folder
- Blockers → Flag in `BLOCKERS.md` at root
- Questions → Ask coordinator in main window

### **Step 3: Integration Points**

**Week 1**: Agents work independently
- No integration yet
- Focus on their component
- Create interfaces first

**Week 2**: Start integration
- Coordinator creates shared types
- Agents use shared types
- Test interfaces

**Week 3**: Full integration
- All components connected
- End-to-end testing
- Performance optimization

**Week 4**: Polish & launch
- Bug fixes
- Documentation
- Marketing
- LAUNCH!

## 🚧 POTENTIAL RISKS & MITIGATION

### **Risk 1: Integration Issues**
**Mitigation**: Coordinator defines interfaces early, agents implement to spec

### **Risk 2: Agent Blockers**
**Mitigation**: Daily check-ins, quick responses from coordinator

### **Risk 3: Inconsistent Code Style**
**Mitigation**: ESLint/Prettier configured, enforced in all packages

### **Risk 4: Test Failures**
**Mitigation**: Agent 6 runs continuous tests, alerts on failures

### **Risk 5: Timeline Slippage**
**Mitigation**: Weekly reviews, adjust scope if needed

---

## 💡 TIPS FOR AGENTS

### **Do's**:
✅ Read your prompt carefully
✅ Follow the exact structure specified
✅ Write tests FIRST (TDD)
✅ Use TypeScript strict mode
✅ Document everything (JSDoc)
✅ Ask coordinator if unclear
✅ Update your status daily
✅ Focus on your component only

### **Don'ts**:
❌ Don't modify other agents' code
❌ Don't create placeholders/TODOs
❌ Don't skip tests
❌ Don't use deprecated APIs
❌ Don't work in silos (communicate!)
❌ Don't change interfaces without asking
❌ Don't commit broken code

## 🎓 LEARNING FROM THIS APPROACH

**Why This Works**:
1. **Specialization**: Each agent becomes expert in their domain
2. **Parallelization**: 6x faster than sequential
3. **Clear boundaries**: No conflicts between agents
4. **Integration points**: Well-defined interfaces
5. **Coordinator oversight**: Ensures quality & consistency

**Lessons for Future**:
- This model scales to 10+ agents
- Can be used for other large projects
- Communication is key
- Clear interfaces are essential
- Daily coordination prevents drift
