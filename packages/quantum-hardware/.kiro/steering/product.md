# Product Overview

## Quantum Hardware Optimization System

A comprehensive hardware-aware optimization framework for quantum computing that provides unified access to multiple quantum computing platforms including IBM Quantum, Google Quantum, IonQ, Rigetti, AWS Braket, Azure Quantum, and PennyLane.

## Core Purpose

Enable developers to write quantum circuits once and automatically optimize them for execution on any quantum hardware platform, abstracting away provider-specific complexities while maximizing circuit fidelity and minimizing execution costs.

## Key Capabilities

- **Multi-Provider Support**: Unified interface for 7+ quantum computing platforms
- **Device Characterization**: Real-time calibration data, topology analysis, and device registry
- **Circuit Optimization**: Qubit mapping, gate scheduling, and SWAP minimization
- **Intelligent Matching**: Automatic device selection based on circuit requirements and constraints
- **Cost & Fidelity Analysis**: Predict execution costs and circuit fidelity before running
- **PennyLane Integration**: Seamless integration with quantum machine learning workflows
- **Error Mitigation**: Built-in support for ZNE, CDR, PEC techniques

## Target Users

Quantum algorithm developers, researchers, and quantum machine learning practitioners who need to execute circuits across different quantum hardware platforms without managing provider-specific details.
