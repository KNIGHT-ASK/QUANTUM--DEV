# Product Overview

Multi-framework quantum code generator that produces production-ready Python code for Qiskit, Cirq, and PennyLane from a unified physics-first intermediate representation (QuantumIR).

## Core Value Proposition

Expert-level quantum computing code generation with advanced features:
- Error mitigation (ZNE, dynamical decoupling, PEC, readout mitigation)
- Hamiltonian simulation with Trotter decomposition
- Variational algorithms (VQE, QAOA, ADAPT-VQE)
- Physics validation (symmetry preservation, conservation laws)
- Hardware-aware circuit optimization
- Noise modeling and fidelity estimation

## Target Users

Quantum computing researchers and scientists who need production-ready implementations of advanced quantum algorithms with built-in error mitigation and physics validation.

## Key Differentiators

1. Physics-first approach - preserves Hamiltonian, symmetries, and conservation laws
2. Research-backed implementations based on latest arXiv papers
3. Multi-framework support from single IR
4. Comprehensive error mitigation and noise modeling
5. Hardware-aware compilation and optimization
